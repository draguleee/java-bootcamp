/**
 * First Java code
 * 
 * The process:
 * 
 * 1. Create a folder.
 * 
 * 2. Launch the folder from Visual Studio Code.
 * 
 * 3. Create a Java file:
 *    - Name your file CamelCase: first letter of every word is capitalized and the words are joined together.
 *    - For the file to be a Java file, it has to have the .java extension.
 *
 * 4. Create a Java class insinde of the Java file:
 *    - You must write all of the Java code in a class
 *      * 'class': keyword
 *      * 'HelloJava': class name
 *      * {...} : code
 *    - The class name needs to always match the file name
 * 
 * 5. Your class needsa main() method:
 *    - main() is the entry point of a Java application
 *    - This is where Java starts running your code
 * 
 * 6. Semi-colon: means end of statement and it is mandatory!
 * 
 * 7. Code is case-sensitive!
 * 
 * 8. Commands:
 *    - Compile code: javac your_file.java
 *    - Run code: java your_file
 * 
 * 9. Turn on autosave: File -> Autosave
