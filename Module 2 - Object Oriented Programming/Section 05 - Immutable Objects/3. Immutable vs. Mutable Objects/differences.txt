Immutable Objects:
* Immutable objects are considered to be safer because they cannot be modified after creation 
* The state of an immutable object cannot be changed which can prevent side effects and make code more predictable
* References can be shared safely across your application

Muta
* Mutable objects are considered to be less safe because they can be modified after creation
* Avoid setting two ariables equal to each other because sharing references can lead to unintended side effects
