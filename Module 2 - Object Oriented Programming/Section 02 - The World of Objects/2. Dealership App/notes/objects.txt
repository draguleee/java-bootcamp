Objects: make your code organized and easier to understand

Object Oriented Programming:
* Organizing your code around Objects
* purpose: write high-quality code

Application Requirements:
* A car is identified by its make, price, year and color
* Each car must drive to the nearest exit


The Process:

1. Identify the objects:
   * An object is a thing that contains fields
   * An object is a thing that can perform tasks

2. Create the class for the corresponding object:
   * A class is a blueprint from which you can create an object

3. From the class created at step 2, you will create instances of that class
